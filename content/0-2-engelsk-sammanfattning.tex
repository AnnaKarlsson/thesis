The number of connected devices connected to the Internet is growing rapidly, when talking about devices it also contains the once not having any contact with humans. This types of devices is the once that is expected growing the most. That is why the field of device fingerprinting is an area that which require more investigation. This thesis measure and evaluates the use of the accelerometer, camera and gyroscope sensors of a mobile device as fingerprinting of a device. The method used is based on previous research in sensor identification together with methods used for designing a biometric system. The combination with long-proven methods in the biometric area with new research of sensor identification is a new approach of looking at device fingerprinting.
