The number of connected devices connected to the Internet is growing rapidly. When talking about devices it also covers the onces not having any contact with humans. This type of devices are the onces that are expected to increase the most. That is why the field of device fingerprinting is an area that requires further investigation. This thesis measures and evaluates the use of the accelerometer, camera and gyroscope sensors of a mobile device as fingerprinting of a device. The method used is based on previous research in sensor identification together with methods used for designing a biometric system. The combination with long-proven methods in the biometric area with new research of sensor identification is a new approach of looking at device fingerprinting.
